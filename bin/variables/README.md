## Introduction to Variables

In Java, a variable is a named storage location used to hold data values. These values can be of various types, such as numbers, characters, or objects. Variables are essential for storing and manipulating data within a program.

## Declaring Variables

To use a variable in Java, you need to declare it first. The declaration specifies the variable's type and name. Here's the syntax for variable declaration:

```java
data_type variable_name;
```

## Variable Types
Java supports several types of variables, including:

Primitive Types: These are basic data types built into the language, such as int, double, char, boolean, etc. They store simple values.
Reference Types: These variables hold references (memory addresses) to objects. Examples include classes, interfaces, arrays, etc.
 
## Initializing Variables

Variables can be initialized when declared or later in the program. Initializing a variable means giving it an initial value. For example:


```java 
int age = 25; // Initializing during declaration
double pi;    // Declaring without initialization
pi = 3.1416;   // Initializing later
```

## Variable Naming Rules
# Variable names must follow these rules:

Start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters can include letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Java is case-sensitive, so myVariable and MyVariable are different.

## Scope of Variables

The scope of a variable refers to the region of the program where the variable is accessible. There are three main scopes in Java:

`Block Scope`: Variables declared within a block of code (within curly braces) are only accessible within that block.
`Method Scope`: Variables declared within a method are accessible within that method.
`Class Scope`: Class-level variables (also known as instance variables) are accessible throughout the class.

## Internal Working of Variables

Internally, Java variables are stored in memory locations. Primitive types are stored directly with their values, while reference types hold memory addresses that point to actual objects stored in the heap memory.

## Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating the usage of Java variables:

```Java
public class VariableExamples {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 42;
        double price = 19.99;
        char initial = 'J';
        boolean isTrue = true;
        String name = "Java Variables";

        System.out.println("Number: " + number);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
        System.out.println("Initial: " + initial);
        System.out.println("Is True: " + isTrue);
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    }
}
```
